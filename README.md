# Optical-Mounts

Two types of systems, standalones and compatible replacements.

List of types of mounts:
- Rails
- Rail connectors
- Vertical Post holder
- Vertical Posts
- 3-axis mirror mount
- Lens mount
- Irises
- Linear gantry
- Slit holder
- V mount for lasers
- Rotational gantry
- Rotational polarizer

All items should be modular, for example in the case of the irises, they should fit into the lens mounts, create a generic mount and multiple items that can fit within.

The decision remains as to fully 3d printed or using metal inserts to ensure compatibility with optical tables.
