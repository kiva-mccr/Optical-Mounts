# Optical-Mounts

Two types of systems, standalones and compatible replacements.

List of types of mounts:
- Rails
- Rail connectors
- Vertical Post holder
- Vertical Posts
- 3-axis mirror mount
- Lens mount
- Irises
- Linear gantry
- Slit holder
- V mount for lasers
- Rotational gantry
- Rotational polarizer
- Lenses
- Prisms
- Mirror plates
- Parabolic mirrors
- Oooo maybe a full 3D printed casagran telescope
- slits & apetures
- beam splitter (two prisms glued together with epoxy)
- Maybe a lens processing and lapping machine
- Maybe grating surfaces

All items should be modular, for example in the case of the irises, they should fit into the lens mounts, create a generic mount and multiple items that can fit within.

The decision remains as to fully 3d printed or using metal inserts to ensure compatibility with optical tables.
